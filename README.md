## Cinema Center

This movie catalog is a web application built for movie enthusiasts. It pulls data from TMDB API to display a variety of movie lists including: Now Playing, Popular, Top Rated, and Upcoming movies. It also includes a detailed page for each movie and a search functionality. With its user-friendly interface and the added dark mode toggle, browsing through movies has never been this enjoyable. You can check out the live project [here](https://cinema-center.netlify.app).
